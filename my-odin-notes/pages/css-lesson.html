    <h1>Basic syntax of CSS Classes</h1>
    <div class="content1-style">
        <p>At the most basic level, CSS is made up of various rules.
             These rules are made up of a selector (more on this in
              a bit) and a semi-colon separated list of declarations
              , with each of those declarations being made up of a 
              <span>property:value pair.</span></p>

    <h1>Type of selectors</h1>
    <div class="content2-style">
        <h2>Selectors</h2>
        <p><span>Selectors</span> simply refer to the HTML elements to which CSS rules apply; 
        they’r what is actually being “selected” for each rule. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content2-style">
        <div class="text-style">
            <h2>Universal selector</h2>
            <p>The universal selector will select elements of any
                type, hence the name “universal”, and the syntax
                for it is a simple asterisk. In the example below,
                every element would have the color: purple; style
                applied to it. </p>
