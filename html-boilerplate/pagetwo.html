		<p class="Vanessa"> In computing, plain text is a loose term for data (e.g. flie contents) that represent only characters
			of readable material but not its graphical representation nor other objects (floating-point numbers, images, etc.)
			. It may also include a limited number of "whitespace" characters that affect simple arrangement of text, such as
			spaces, line breaks, or tabulation characters. Plain text is different from formatted text, where style information
			is included; from structured text, where structural parts of the document such as paragraphs, sections, and the 
			like are identified; and from binary flies in which some portions must be interpreted as binary objects 
			(encoded integers, real numbers, images, etc.).
		</p>

		<div class="container">
			<p>
			The term is sometimes used quite loosely, to mean flies that contain only "readable" content
			or just flies with nothing that the speaker does not prefer. For example, that could exclude 
			any indication of fonts or layout (such as markup, markdown, or even tabs); characters such as 
			curly quotes, non-breaking spaces, soft hyphens, em dashes, and/or ligatures; or other things.
					
			In principle, plain text can be in any encoding, but occasionally the term is taken to imply ASCII
			As Unicode-based encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16 become more common, that usage may be shrinking
